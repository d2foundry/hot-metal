# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>Why is the Magazine stat on X weapon slightly off?</summary>
  The Magazine stat we get from Bungie's API has a documented history of being inaccurate to what's in game. We do our best to account for these discrepancies, but expect the numbers to occasionally be a bit off. It's just how it is.
