# Roll Editor

ðŸš§ These docs are still under construction! ðŸš§

You can contribute to them on [Github](https://github.com/d2foundry/hot-metal/tree/main/docs/features).

## Overview

With the Roll Editor screen, you can see any weapon's stats, what perks are currently available, and how mods, abilities, and exotic armor can affect your weapon. If you have ever wondered how opening shot or heating up affects your weapons stats, the Roll Editor seeks to clarify that for you in a clear and concise way. Then, once you have created the perfect roll for your weapon, you can share it with your friends and/or export it to a DIM wishlist.

### Navigating the Roll Editor

The Roll Editor screen is divided into six distinct sections. They are as follows: the weapon header, the toolbar, stats, perks (including masterwork and weapon mods), effects, and lastly, the weapon's metadata. 

In the weapon header on the left side you will find the inventory image of the weapon, its name, and what weapon type it is, e.g. "hand cannon". On the right side of the header, from left to right, you will find the [share button](#share), [screenshot mode](#screenshot-mode), and the add to [compare](#compare) functionality. 

The toolbar has three sections within it. The first section contains a button to clear the weapon of all settings, bringing it to its base form, and a button to randomize a roll which in essence simulates a random drop you can get in game. The middle section contains the single select and multi select toggle. Single select will allow you to pick one perk in each column and these selections will affect the stats shown in that section. These perks are marked by being filled in blue. Multi select allows you to add additional perks for screenshot mode and these selections will not affect the stat screen. These perks are marked by a blue outline around the perk. The last section is the PvP and PvE toggle. If PvE is selected, the Encounter picker becomes active and allows you to set the environment for the weapon.

The [stats](#weapon-stats) accordion will have the [basic stats](#basic-stats) of a given weapon expanded by default. There you will find the same stats as shown on a weapon inspect screen in game. Below there are expandable accordions with additional, more [advanced stats](#advanced-stats). These will give you details such as ADS speed, flinch resist, and damage falloff information.

The [perks](#perks) section will allow you to see what perks, masterworks, and mods are available for that weapon. Selecting any of these will adjust the values in the stats section accordingly. The perks shown are what can be currently rolled on that given weapon. Just below the perks is where you can select your masterwork and below that is where weapon mods can be found. If the weapon is of "master-level" (Adept, Timelost, etc), then adept mods will also be able to be chosen. 

The [effects](#effects) section will allow you to toggle whether or not a certain perk is active and/or how many stacks are active, e.g. heating up x1 vs x2. You will then be able to select any exotic armor, armor mods, and add whatever buffs, debuffs, and abilities you want to apply to your stats. This takes into account things that do not stack as well, such as empowering rift and radiant and only counts the highest buff. 

The metadata for a weapon will show what damage type it is, is it a primary, secondary, or heavy, its archetype or exotic perk, and what loot source you can acquire it from. Additionally, the weapon will be pictured as well as its lore snippet written below.
